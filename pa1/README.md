Programming Assignment 1

Task 1: write a program in ac and dc that computes y=3x+5 where x=7.  The final answer should be all that prints.

Task 2: write a program in ac and dc that computes u = 2a + 3b, v = (a-b)^2, and w = u+v for a = 6, b = 2.  At the end of each program, print u, v, and w (in that order) only.

Task 3: write a program in ac and dc that computes (x+y)^2 and (x^2+2xy+y^2), and then computes the difference e = (x+y)^2 - (x^2 + 2xy + y^2).  Then print e.  Choose any values for x and y that you like...clearly, no matter what you choose, e should be 0.

Reminders about ac:
You can use int declarations (like "i a"), arithmetic assignments (like "a = b + 3"), and print statements ("p a").  

Reminders about dc:
You can use the d operator if you like.  You will need to use registers.  Treat registers as being able to hold a single object each, not as they truly are (which is being themselves a stack).

File naming:
Your submission should have six new files: problem1.ac, problem1.dc, problem2.ac, problem2.dc, etc.

Submitting:
Submit by making a release and tagging it "submission".  This assignment will be manually graded, but others may use autograding/test cases.
